## Power Ups
The game features two power-ups that can give the player an advantage:
### Canon power-up:
This power-up provides the player with a bigger laser that can destroy multiple enemies at once for a few seconds.
### Freeze power-up:
This power-up freezes all enemies on the screen, except those that are very low, to prevent the player from colliding into them.

#### Be sure to grab these power-ups when they appear to gain an edge in the game.
